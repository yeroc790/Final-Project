<h3>List of things we need</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Map Class - contains a multidimensional array of type Tile</li>
  <li>Base Enemy class as well as derived classes (brainstorming should be done to determine list of enemies and attributes)</li>
  <li>Base Item class with derived classes Weapon, Armor, Utility, and possibly others</li>
  <li>A GUI should be designed, but doesn't need to be right away</li>
  <li>A menu to navigate through the game (draw inspiration from Undertale)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Brain Dump</h3>
Design the game concept<br>
I'm thinking we do a grid system, where you start in a specific tile and have to explore your surroundings by moving up, down, left, or right.<br>
You could find items on the ground or in chests, there could be enemies in certain tiles, blocking hallways.<br>

There should probably be a way to display the map<br>
There should be the complete map, and the map that the player has discovered, with each movement in a direction unlocking new tiles in the map<br>

Items could include weapons and armor, possibly 1 time utilities such as healing potions, strength potions, etc.
Another option is having keys

Enemies could drop items once defeated, this would be based on RNG.
